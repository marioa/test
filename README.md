<ul>
<li>Dreadful situation with professor receiving peer-review requesting modification of previous figures for which there’s no reproducible code.</li>
<li>Checklist of questions like:  
    <ul>
    <li>Do you collect/ record/ recode/ analyse/ report on data electronically?</li>
    <li>Do you spend lots of time repeating tasks manually or answering the same questions over and over?</li>
    <li>“Have you spent hours trying to locate your or your lab’s or students’ files?</li>
    <li>Do you always know which is the most recent version of your paper/graphs/code?</li>
    <li>Have you spent a day trying to re-do some analysis or change a graph in response to reviewer comments?</li> 
      </ul></li>
    <li>If you answered yes to any of the above, join the “new wave” of open and sustainable research</li>

   <td colspan="2" >WHY DO OPEN & SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH?
<ul>
<li>There is a general shift towards open and sustainable research from funders, publishers and grassroots (include here a graph or general stats on open research)</li>
<li>Benefit to you, to your institution, and your entire research field 
<ul>
<li>Reusability for saving time and money</li>
<li>Increasing impact (REF), increasing citations and visibility, raising personal/group profile</li>
<li>Increased connections & networks, more collaborations, not working in isolated silos</li> 
</ul></li> 
<li>For the greater good of society and advancing research in general</li>
</ul>

  Replication issues: Power pose - did not replicate: newspapers headline “Power posing doesn’t replicate!”?</p>

   <td>SOLUTION 1
<p>
Code-based analysis (vs point-and-click like SPSS) allows you and others to audit. Releasing data and code allows others to attempt to replicate. +++?</p>

Sharing data (whenever possible) and results (including null results) is a moral obligation (research funding often from taxes)</p>

Share Data on an open data repository (your institution might have one), preferably one which gives a DOI or permanent link?</p>

“Ghost” of past code/data/PhD students/PIs</p>

Phd student relay vs journey that each phd student has to start</p>
<p>
Building research group resources</p>
<p>
Have a virtual phd student from the past inducting/training new phd students. Or, in a similar, futuristic scenario that’s impossible for now, we could picture a lab/department member backing up their mind’s <em>drive</em> as a way of cumulative knowledge and version control. The final message would be that, at present, this is done on lab logs and databases, StackExchange, Git/GitHub,...</p>

increasing impact (REF), increasing citations and visibility, more collaborations, raising personal/group profile. Examples? Reference for effect:</p>

Increased citations with open data: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565">https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Recording general practices such as contacting specific technical support, SSI, library, etc. For instance, when a Freedom of Information Request is made, it is published, to save processing time in future.</li>
<li>Version control (including hosting) needed with less limitations than Dropbox, etc., as some of these only allow retrieving the last 100 versions, retrieving deleted files for 30 days only, etc.</li>
<li>Data repositories</li>
<li>List of resources used: e.g., StackExchange for multiple disciplines ranging Linguistics to Sports (<a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites">https://stackexchange.com/sites</a>).</li>
